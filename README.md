## Who am I?

My <a href="lorenamesa.com/about">bio</a> covers a bit of what I do.

> Political scientist turned coder, Lorena Mesa is a data engineer on GitHub's dependency graph team, Director and Vice-Chair, Elect on the Python Software Foundation, JOSS Editor, and PyLadies Chicago co-organizer. 

I think this sums me up well:

> One part activist, one part Star Wars fanatic, and another part Trekkie, I abide by the motto to "live long, Python :snake: & prosper :vulcan_salute:".

## What's on my mind?

As technologists, it is our duty to stay informed. Educate ourselves on bias in tech as well as how tech impacts issues of equity. To educate myself, I've kicked started a [reading list on bias and equity in tech](http://biasin.tech). Have suggestions? Add to the list today :point_right: [here](https://github.com/lorenanicole/tech-equity-reading/).
