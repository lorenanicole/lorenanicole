# Who is Lorena "La Tigresa" Nicole?

Political scientist turned coder, Lorena Mesa is a data engineer on GitHub's dependency graph team, Director and Vice-Chair, Elect on the Python Software Foundation, JOSS Editor, and PyLadies Chicago co-organizer. 

Lorena's time at Obama for America and her subsequent graduate research required her to learn how to transform messy, incomplete data into intelligible analysis on topics like predicting Latinx voter behavior. It's this unique background in research and applied mathematics that drove Lorena to pursue a career in engineering and data science. 

One part activist, one part Star Wars fanatic, and another part Trekkie, Lorena abides by the motto to "live long, Python :snake: & prosper :vulcan_salute: ".

## What's on @lorenanicole's mind?

As technologists, it is our duty to stay informed. Educate ourselves on bias in tech as well as how tech impacts issues of equity. To educate myself, I've kicked started a [reading list on bias and equity in tech](http://biasin.tech). Have suggestions? Add to the list today :point_right: [here](https://github.com/lorenanicole/tech-equity-reading/).
